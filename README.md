This work provides the basis to understand the challenges and opportunities to promote Blockchain and IoT in Agrifood supply chain management for developing countries. Our research is driven by a pragmatic question: how to bring Blockchain-based AgriFood supply chain management solutions to the reality of developing countries? The reality of these environments demand strategies to cope with social-market-infrastructural issues like low literacy, widespread lack of education, poor IT infrastructure, obsolete processes, lack of governmental good-will, between others. Nonetheless, current commercial solutions are designed for developed markets, counting on modern communication infrastructure, and sponsorship by large corporations. We present a survey of related research and the state-of-the-art, provide an analysis of the challenges and opportunities,  and propose a Reference Architecture for a \emph{Open Distributed AgriFood Supply Chain Management} as a Blockchain-based and IoT-centred solution to promote social engagement of all players in developing countries, along with a number of pre-build solutions to provide relevant information to all players, promote full transparency into the demand chain, and advance democratic and fair participation towards sustainable goals and social good.
